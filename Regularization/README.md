## Regularization

Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting and improve the generalization of a model. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, which encourages the model to learn simpler patterns and avoid fitting the training data too closely.


## Regularization offers several benefits in machine learning:

- Prevents overfitting: Regularization helps to reduce the impact of noise and irrelevant features in the training data, making the model less prone to overfitting. It improves the model's ability to generalize well to unseen data.

- Controls model complexity: By adding a penalty term to the loss function, regularization encourages the model to select a simpler set of features and avoid complex relationships. This helps to prevent over-parameterization and improves model interpretability.

- Improves model performance: Regularization techniques can lead to better model performance by reducing variance and increasing stability. It helps in achieving a balance between bias and variance, leading to optimal model performance.

## Types of Regularization
There are several types of regularization techniques commonly used in machine learning for example:

- L1 Regularization (Lasso): L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients. It encourages sparsity in the model by driving some coefficients to zero, effectively performing feature selection.

- L2 Regularization (Ridge): L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients. It encourages the model to distribute the impact of different features more evenly, reducing the influence of outliers and making the model more robust.
