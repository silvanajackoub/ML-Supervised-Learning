## Optimizers
Optimizers are algorithms used in machine learning to improve the performance of models by minimizing the loss function. The loss function measures how well the model is performing on a given task, and the optimizer adjusts the model's parameters to minimize the loss.

## Types of Optimizers
There are several types of optimizers, including:

- Gradient Descent: A simple optimizer that updates the model's parameters in the direction of the negative gradient of the loss function.

- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD): A variation of gradient descent that updates the parameters using a randomly sampled subset of the training data.

- Adam: An adaptive optimizer that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the gradient's variance and momentum.
- RMSProp: An adaptive optimizer that adjusts the learning rate for each parameter based on the moving average of the squared gradients.

## Choosing an Optimizer
Choosing an optimizer depends on several factors, including the type of model, the size of the dataset, and the complexity of the task. In general, Adam is a good default choice for most tasks, but it's always a good idea to experiment with different optimizers to find the one that works best for your specific use case.
