## Neural Network Summary
A neural network is a type of machine learning model that is inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. It consists of a network of interconnected nodes, called neurons that work together to process and interpret input data.

## Architecture
The architecture of a neural network typically consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer is composed of multiple neurons, and each neuron is connected to other neurons in adjacent layers.

## Activation Functions
An activation function is applied to each neuron in the network to introduce nonlinearity into the model. Common activation functions include the sigmoid function, the ReLU function, and the softmax function.

## Training
Training a neural network involves adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons to minimize the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. This is typically done using an optimization algorithm.
One commonly used optimization algorithm is stochastic gradient descent, which updates the weights and biases based on the error calculated from a single training example at a time. However, other optimization algorithms can also be used, such as:

- Batch gradient descent: This algorithm computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights and biases for the entire training dataset, rather than just a single example as in stochastic gradient descent.
- Mini-batch gradient descent: This algorithm computes the gradient of the cost function with respect to the weights and biases for a small subset of the training dataset, called a mini-batch.
## Feedforward and Backpropagation
Feedforward refers to the process of passing input data through the neural network from the input layer to the output layer. Backpropagation, on the other hand, is the process of adjusting the weights and biases of the neurons in the network during training. This is done by computing the error between the predicted output and the actual output, and propagating this error backwards through the network to adjust the weights and biases of the neurons.

## Applications
Neural networks have many applications in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition. They have also been used in finance, healthcare, and transportation.
